Farm your fields, explore the world, and sleep to progress time!

# Controls

Most of the controls are documented in-game, but those that are not are listed below:

- Items on your hotbar can be equipped in four different ways:
	1. Clicking directly on the hotbar item
	2. Using numbers 1-9 and 0 on your keyboard (not the numpad)
	3. Scrolling the mouse wheel up or down
	4. Holding shift and press the left or right arrow keys
- The interior of the shop is currently not created, but the shop menu can still be accessed by standing in front of the door and pressing the "E" key
- Items in the inventory can be placed in the first available slot in the hotbar by shift-clicking, or vice versa (similar to Minecraft)

# Development

This project was created in Godot, a game engine similar to Unity that uses GDScript, a Python-like programming language. Originally, I undertook this project with 5 other team members for a final project in my Game Development class in college.

Since then, I decided to continue development on this project alone as my senior/capstone project. I majorly reworked every system in the game that my group members had previously made; little remains of what they originally did, so I am proud to call this a solo project.

The only things that do remain from when this was a group project are outlined below:
- Special thanks to Jordyn Sato for her main menu design and a couple of tilesets she found.
- Special thanks to Serena Ing for the many tilesets she found and her design of both the exterior and interior of the player's home.

Currently, the interior of the caves, inn, and shop are inaccessible, though the shop can still be used by pressing the "E" key outside the front door.

# Planned Features

There are many, many planned features for this game, but as a solo developer looking for a full-time job, I have little time to implement these. If you would like to collaborate with me or ask me about the project, feel free to email me at kennyhaworth@yahoo.com.
